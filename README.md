# SBootCRUDEmployeeAndDept
This is adding Employee and Department tables.As Department contains multiple employes it is clearly a one to many relationship when reading from the 
department to the employee table.

It also tries to use h2 in-memory database to do CRUD
after that the database will be changed to mysql table.

After it is done, I will include:
the sql script
thymeleaf html codes for crud and 
some bootstrap will be applied.
